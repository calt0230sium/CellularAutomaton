# CellularAutomaton
Programming cellular automata to learn Haskell (2019 project)

## Run the project :

In the folder build run the following command :
```
./Main.exe
```

## Build the project :

In order to build the project, you need to install [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/downloads/) :
- GHC to compile.
- cabal to install dependencies.
- Stack to have many module ready to use.

The project requires the following modules :
- System.Random
- Control.Concurrent
- System.Process

After installing all the dependencies, just run the make command[^1] :
```
make
```

## Explanation :

### Elementary cellular automaton :

It works like this : [Elementary cellular automaton](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ElementaryCellularAutomaton.html).
You just have to enter the rule in decimal and the program will print some lines generated by the automaton.
The initial state is ``n/2 empty cells`` , ``1`` , ``n/2 empty cells``.

### 2D cellular automaton :

The 2d cellular automaton cannot work like the elementary automaton. 
Indeed, each cell has 8 neighbors instead of 2, so 2^9 bits are needed to represent all possible states of a cell.
So I chose a simpler representation of the rules that describe the state of each cell according to the number of living cells that surround it.
The rules are modeled by an array of length 8 representing the number of possible neighbors: each cell describes a life state (Dead, Alive or Born).
The default rule is the Game of Life rule:
```
Dead, Dead, Alive, Born, Dead, Dead, Dead, Dead, Dead
```

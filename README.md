# CellularAutomaton
Programming cellular automata to learn Haskell (2019 project)

## Run the project :

In the folder build run the following command :
```
./Main.exe
```

## Build the project :

In order to build the project, you need to install [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/downloads/) :
- GHC to compile.
- cabal to install dependencies.
- Stack to have many module ready to use.

The project requires the following modules :
- System.Random
- Control.Concurrent
- System.Process

After installing all the dependencies, just run the make command[^1] :
```
make
```

## Explanation :

### Elementary cellular automaton :

It works like this : [Elementary cellular automaton](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ElementaryCellularAutomaton.html).
You just need to enter the rule in decimal and the program will print some lines generated by the automaton.
The initial state is ``n/2 empty cells`` , ``1`` , ``n/2 empty cells``.

### 2D cellular automaton :

The 2d cellular automaton can't works like the Elementary one. 
Indeed, each cells pocess 8 neighbors instead of 2, so you need ``2^8`` bits to represent all the possible states. 
So instead, I chose a more simple representation of rule which describe the state of each cells depending the number of their neighbors.
